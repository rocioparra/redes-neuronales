Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.\n","\n","The objective of this project is to predict daily sales for 1,115 stores located across Germany. Reliable sales forecasts enable store managers to create effective staff schedules that increase productivity and motivation. By creating a robust prediction model, store managers can stay focused on their customers and their teams.\n","\n","The developed model achieved high accuracy with Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE) 0.23. The formula is:\n","\n","$$\n","\\textrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{\\hat{y}_i - y_i}{y_i}\\right)^2}\n","$$\n","\n","where:\n","\n","- $\\hat{y}_i$ is the actual sales of one store on a particular day\n","- $y_i$ is the corresponding sales predicted by the model\n","- $n$ is the number of predictions made\n","\n","Below is a high-level overview of the steps taken to develop such robust model:\n","1. Transform the raw data into format which is accepted by the machine learning algorithm.\n","2. Build a predictive model by feeding the transformed data to the algorithm.\n","3. Use a seperate set of raw data to evaluate the performnace of the derived model.\n","\n","In particular, the model we uses is deep nerual network, which is also called deep learning and is the underlying model of cutting-edge applications like Siri and AlphaGo.
